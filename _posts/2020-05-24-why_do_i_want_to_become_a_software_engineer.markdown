   My passion for technology is my drving force to become a software engineer. I've bulit computers in the past was not happy with my current carrer path and desided to learn coding. I've been doing construction all my life and was not happy where i was at i was starting to lack perpose. I look at software engineering as a trade of the computer world. It is a set skill one has to figure out and solve problems while being creative at the same time.
